# mosano-eu

Since the 8th of July to the 31st, I worked along side with **Mosano** in an internship, focusing my work in front-end web development. Mosano provides custom software services and focuses on web and mobile application development.

I used technologies such as Gatsby, Graphql, React, Prismic and Emotion.

  Gatsby is a static site generator.

During my Mosano-EU project I used a variety of technologies that supported my web application. In my web application I have 6 pages: the Homepage, What, Who, How, Contact and Join Us pages.
