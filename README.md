# mosano-eu

Since the 8th of July to the 31st, I worked along side with **Mosano** in an internship, focusing my work in front-end web development. Mosano provides custom software services and focuses on web and mobile application development.

I used technologies such as Gatsby [![gatsby logo](/gatsby-logo.png)](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs "Documentation") , Graphql [![graphql logo](GraphQL_Logo.svg.png)](https://graphql.org/learn "Documentation"), React [![react logo](React.js_logo-512.png)](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#learn-react "Documentation"), Prismic [![Prismic logo](prismic-logo.png)](https://prismic.io/docs "Documentation") and Emotion [![Emotion logo](emotion-logo.png)](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction "Documentation").


#### Gatsby [![gatsby logo](/gatsby-logo.png)](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs "Documentation") 

  [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a static site generator that are Progressive Web Apps. It is React-based and GraphQL powered. It basically joins the best parts of React, Webpack, React-router, GraphQL and other front-end tools to make a better developer experience. Gatsby follows latest web standards and are optimized to be highly performant.
 
#### GraphQL [![graphql logo](GraphQL_Logo.svg.png)](https://graphql.org/learn "Documentation")

    "[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling   those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable   description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to   ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over   time, and enables powerful developer tools."
  
  GraphQL allows you to declaratively express your data needs. This is done with queries, queries are the representation of the data you need. An example: 
  
  ~~~~
  query {
    prismicHomepage{
      data 
        title {
          text
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ~~~~

During my Mosano-EU project I used a variety of technologies that supported my web application. In my web application I have 6 pages: the Homepage, What, Who, How, Contact and Join Us pages.
