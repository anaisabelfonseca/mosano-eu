# mosano-eu

Since the 8th of July to the 31st, I worked along side with **Mosano** in an internship, focusing my work in front-end web development. Mosano provides custom software services and focuses on web and mobile application development.

I used technologies such as Gatsby, Graphql, React, Prismic and Emotion.

#### Gatsby [![gatsby logo](/gatsby-logo.png)](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs "Documentation") 

  [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a static site generator that are Progressive Web Apps. It is React-based and GraphQL powered. It basically joins the best parts of React, Webpack, React-router, GraphQL and other front-end tools to make a better developer experience. Gatsby follows latest web standards and are optimized to be highly performant.
 

During my Mosano-EU project I used a variety of technologies that supported my web application. In my web application I have 6 pages: the Homepage, What, Who, How, Contact and Join Us pages.
